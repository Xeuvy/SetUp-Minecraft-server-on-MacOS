🚀 Project Overview

This project will help MacOS users create their own Minecraft server on their device.
📥 Installation Features

    My script will install a server using the Paper core.

    Available versions: From 1.16.5 to 1.21.8.

    The script can automatically install and configure the required Java version for the server.

    Alternatively, you can use your system’s Java—the script supports this option.

📂 Server Folder Setup

    The script creates a server folder on your desktop (you can choose its name during setup).

    Renaming the folder later won’t break the server—it will still launch correctly.

⚙️ Server Management

Inside the server folder, you’ll find two scripts:

    ▶️ StartServer.sh – Launches the server.

    🔄 RestartServer.sh – Restarts the server (currently works a bit buggy, but I’ll fix it in the future!).
